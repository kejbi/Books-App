Project made for edx cs50 course python-javasript.

You have to init your data base with python file import_books.py.

Then run the app with 'python run.py'.

You can search the books by author, title and isbn. All matching results are shown to user. Then you can click the result and see book's details and leave a review (only if you're logged in). 

'Account' route isn't made - not the clue of that course.
